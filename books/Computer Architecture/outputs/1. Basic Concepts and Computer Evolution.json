          "answer": "An MMU (Memory Management Unit) supports virtual memory by translating virtual addresses to physical addresses using page tables, enabling features like demand paging and process isolation in high-level OSs. An MPU (Memory Protection Unit) only defines access permissions (Read/Write/Execute) for specific physical memory regions without address translation, ensuring determinism and protection in real-time/embedded systems."

          "level": "mid-level",
          "answer": "The Harvard architecture provides separate buses for instructions and data. This allows the processor to fetch a new instruction and read/write data to memory in the same clock cycle, eliminating the 'von Neumann bottleneck' where the CPU must wait for the bus to become available."
