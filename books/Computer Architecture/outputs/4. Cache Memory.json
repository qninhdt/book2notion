N-way set associativity mitigates this by providing N possible slots (lines) per set, allowing multiple blocks that map to the same set to reside in the cache concurrently."

Write-Back reduces bus traffic by only writing on eviction, but it requires complex cache coherency protocols (like MESI) to ensure other cores don't read stale data from main memory while a 'dirty' copy exists in a local cache."
