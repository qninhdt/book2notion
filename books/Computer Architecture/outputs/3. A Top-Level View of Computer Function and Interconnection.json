          "content": "Modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) and gaming rely on **Base Address Registers (BAR)** to map a GPU's or NVMe drive's internal memory directly into the CPU's physical address space. This allows the CPU to perform standard load/store instructions that the Root Complex automatically converts into PCIe Memory Read/Write TLPs. Furthermore, **NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express)** is specifically designed to leverage PCIe's parallelism, using multiple queues to bypass the legacy bottlenecks of the SATA/AHCI stacks."
