They hide implementation details behind clean interfaces:\n\n*   **High-level languages:** Abstract machine code and memory management.\n*   **SQL:** Abstracts disk storage, concurrency control, and crash recovery.\n\nIn distributed systems, finding effective abstractions (e.g., consensus, partitioning) is significantly more challenging than in single-machine environments.",

Accidental complexity arises from the implementation (e.g., manual memory management or poorly chosen data structures). Engineers address accidental complexity through better abstractions and refactoring, while inherent complexity is managed through modularization and clear documentation."
