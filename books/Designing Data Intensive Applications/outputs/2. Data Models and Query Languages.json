This necessitates complex multi-way joins or multiple queries to reconstruct the object, whereas a document model (JSON/BSON) preserves the natural tree structure and provides better **storage locality**.",

This abstraction allows developers to add indexes or change query patterns without rewriting application logic.\n*   **Modern Document Model:** Reverts to nesting for one-to-many relationships but typically uses unique identifiers (document references) to handle many-to-many relationships, avoiding the pointer-traversal pitfalls of CODASYL.",

Similar to dynamic type checking, it excels with heterogeneous data where objects have varying structures.\n\n**Locality Advantage:** Document databases store a document as a single continuous string. This reduces disk seeks when the entire entity is needed. However, updates usually require rewriting the entire document, and retrieving a small field still requires loading the whole record.
